Generating non-perfect mazes and solving them with different algorithms (GUI)
___


## About Project
Maze is generated using recursive backtracking([Maze generating algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)) and than randomly erasing walls between blocks to generate non-perfect maze

## Implemented So far
1. Depth First Serach
2. Breadth First Search
3. Greedy Best first Search
4. A* algorithms
5. Dijkstra (note: as the maze here is in the form of unweighted graph dijkstra will work like Breadth First Search and performance would be lower than actual BFS)
